\begin{abstract}
Synthetic data solves the problems of a lack of data or a lack of access to data. In this paper, we explore synthetic data -- why it is necessary, how to generate it, and how to use it.

\section{Introduction}

Data analysis has changed the landscape of business and research. All data has a story, and data scientists are tasked with telling that story. However, what if the data is inaccessible to the data scientists? Are they out of luck or is it possible to create data that is still actionable?

The solution to this problem is synthetic data. Synthetic data can generated then analyzed just like real data. In the same way that predictions can be made using existing data, synthetic data can be generated.
