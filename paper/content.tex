Synthetic data solves the problems of a lack of data or a lack of access to data. In this paper, we explore synthetic data -- why it is necessary, how to generate it, and how to use it.

\section{Introduction}

Data analysis has changed the landscape of business and research. All data has a story, and data scientists are tasked with telling that story. However, what if the data is inaccessible to the data scientists? Are they out of luck or is it possible to create data that is still actionable?

The solution to this problem is synthetic data. Synthetic data can be generated to look like real data. In the same way that predictions can be made using existing data, synthetic data can be generated. While it may seem illogical, synthetic data can also be analyzed and used to train models.

The most notable synthetic data generator is the Synthetic Data Vault. Developed at MIT, the Synthetic Data Vault uses machine learning techniques to model relational tables. The models can then be used to generate entirely synthetic tables which are true to the form of the originals.\cite{}

\section{Generation}

The first step in synthetic data analysis is to generate the data. The Synthetic Data Vault accomplishes this task using machine learning. First, the natural data is analyzed and modeled. Then, the models are used to generate the synthetic data. The benefit of machine learning is that the models are able to recreate realistic synthetic data points.

Take, for example, a database filled with hospital patient data. Due to the private nature of health data, analysts might not have access to the data. However, a synthetic recreation of the data is possible, which would be perfectly useable for analysis. Suppose there are fields for "height" and "weight". These features have a relationship, positive correlation, which would be captured by the machine learning algorithm.\cite{} Also suppose height is normally distributed. Combine all of these factors together and a normal distribution of heights could be generated with matching weights. While this example is oversimplified, it shows that synthetically-generated data is far more than just random.
