Based on Google's BigTable design, Apache has their own
data store called Accumulo~\cite{hid-sp18-526-www-apache-accumulo}.
Accumulo overlays the Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) and
Apache Zookeeper. Originally created by the US National Security
Agency, Accumulo has a large focus on security and access control. 
Every key/value pair in Accumulo has its own user restrictions. 
Accumulo is used mostly in other open-source projects and in other 
Apache projects such as Fluo, Gora, Hive, Pig, and Rya.
