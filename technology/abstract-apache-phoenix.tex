Apache Phoenix \cite{www-hid-sp18-526-apache-phoenix} 
is an open-source database engine by Apache that works 
in tandem with Hadoop and HBase. The system supports online 
transaction  processing (OLTP). Using SQL and Java database 
connectivity (JDBC), Phoenix allows for queries over millions of rows 
to be executed in milliseconds. Phoenix overlays HBase and allows 
data to be accessed directly via SQL queries (through JDBC). It allows
for indexing and parallelization to greatly reduce query time. Phoenix
is compatible with the host of Hadoop products such as Spark, Hive, 
and MapReduce.
