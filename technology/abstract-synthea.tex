Synthea \cite{www-hid-sp18-526-synthea} is an open-source
medical patient generator. Synthea allows for the full synthetic
generation of medical patients via patient records, which solves
the privacy problems of using real-world patient data.

Each patient generated by Synthea is a full-model: from birth
to present with full demographics. This type of data can be used
for small and large-scale health analysis. The data underlying
these models are generated based on current academic research.
